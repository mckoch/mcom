This document describes the first version of the Micro Content Onject Model and an abstract class lib MicroContentObject (MCO). It is intended as a paper for thinking about, discussing and using an appropiate model to handle microcontent. This approach does not use keywords to find and glue related pieces of microcontent, it merely focusses - beyond computing relvancy from matching strings on web pages - on the fact that content preferably is linked to "real world" related content and applications, driven by criteria and ideas which are as individual as the context a collection of microcontent represents. Implementing MCOM should benefit the programmer as well as the user by accessing content and appropiate context in one convenient model.
